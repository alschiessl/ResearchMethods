    "Please answer the questions below. Copy this notebook and enter your answers underneath each task description, inserting cells as needed. You may use a combination of [python 3](https://python3.guide/), [markdown](http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Notebook/Working%20With%20Markdown%20Cells.html), and [LaTex](https://towardsdatascience.com/write-markdown-latex-in-the-jupyter-notebook-10985edb91fd) to formulate your responses.
